This solution is comprised of two projects, one simple NodeJS server to work as a data source and a
ReactJS front-end to consume data from it.

## Run the NodeJS server

Clone the repo then open a new terminal and navigate to the folder `/src/server` and run

1.  `yarn && yarn start`

For more details, please check the [README](https://github.com/TheOld/PTML/blob/master/server/README.md) file included in the project folder.

## Run the front-end app

On a new terminal session, navigate to `/src` and run

1. `yarn && yarn start`

Keep an eye on the `console` for updates to the store
